### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ i'm Harvy
I am a Frontend developer living in Cali, a city in Colombia. I love building web applications using the MERN stack, I've been working freelance for a long time, however I'm always open to corporate jobs. (I love the startup kind of company though).I really like to collaborate, If you have an idea you can share it with me, maybe we can help each other out!

I'm currently working on [vozmagazine.com](https://vozmagazine.com)

Voz Magazine is a project for independent journalism, I'm part of an incredible team of students that make a great effort in bringing the most honest journalism out for the Colombian comunity, the project is up and running. Go check it out!
Stack: Mongo, Express, React, Node


I never stop learning, I've been doing some fun stuff with **react-native** lately.
